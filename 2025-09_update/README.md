As of September 2025 (after the Autocycler paper was published), two of the assemblers I tested have updated versions:
* [metaMDBG](https://github.com/GaetanBenoitDev/metaMDBG) v1.2
* [Myloasm](https://github.com/bluenote-1577/myloasm) v0.2.0

This directory contains updated methods, results and plots for these new versions.

See this blog post for a description of the results: [rrwick.github.io/2025/09/23/autocycler-benchmark-update.html](https://rrwick.github.io/2025/09/23/autocycler-benchmark-update.html)
