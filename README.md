This repository contains the supplementary data for our paper describing Autocycler:<br>[Wick RR, Stinear TP. Autocycler: long-read consensus assembly for bacterial genomes. bioRxiv. 2025. doi:10.1101/2025.??.??.??????](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.??.??.??????)

If you are looking for Autocycler itself (i.e. the software, not the paper), please see the [Autocycler GitHub repository](https://github.com/rrwick/Autocycler).

This repository contains:
* [`tables.xlsx`](tables.xlsx): all supplementary tables for the paper.
* [`commands.md`](commands.md): methods and exact commands used to generate the data shown in Figure 2 and the supplementary tables.
* [`assess_assembly.py`](assess_assembly.py): the Python script used to quantify assembly accuracy.
* [`plots.Rmd`](plots.Rmd): R code for generating the plots in Figure 2.

The datasets used in this paper (reads, assemblies, and references) are too large to host here but can be downloaded from: [TBD](TBD).
